        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have 13 years experience working in the service industry. I have worked in restaurants in many different capacities and currently manage and bartend for a large corporate chain. As to how this applies to a job in the tech industry, I am not yet certain.</p>
        <p>I am very good at communicating and collaborating with coworkers. I also have extensive experience interacting with customers. I spent many years as a trainer and have gained some experience in teaching others. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the TeamTreehouse Techdegree Program. This will provide a Front End Certification. I intend to finish their Techdegree program in less than 8 months. I also dabble with the FreeCodeCamp program and hope to complete some of their certifications as well. I frequently utilize resources on W3Schools and Mozilla Developer Network for additional reading. I use Codecademy for practice during down time as well.</p>
        <p>I plan to have a comprehensive understanding of Web Development by the end of this year. I intend to become confident and proficient using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby.</p>
